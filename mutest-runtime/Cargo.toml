#        resolution in generated code is implemented, cargo might be able to inject the crate for us.

# Injected dependencies:
# Because mutest-runtime is injected into mutated crates generated by mutest-rs,
# some of its dependencies must be injected as well (e.g. if exposed through macro expansions),
# while also avoiding name collisions with the crate's own externs.
# Because of this, mutest-rs only injects extern dependencies of mutest-runtime
# that are renamed to `__mutest_runtime_public_dep_*`.
